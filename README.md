# jCart
eCommerce Shopping Cart system built on PHP

jCart is a free Ajax shopping cart thatâ€™s easy to install and customize.
Based on jQuery and PHP, jCart handles visitor input without reloading the page and is fully functional even without javascript.

jCart was created by Doug Whitney, and maintained through version 1.3, when he stopped development.

During some of this time I assisted Doug with bugfixes, and online user support. I had created some of my own
private modifications to jCart from my work on various websites, and have decided to release them publicly.
