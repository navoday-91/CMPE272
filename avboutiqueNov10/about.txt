AV's Clothing Store was established in 1993. The original owner of the store Ms. Avi Nemble started it as a way to get away from her daily monotonous routine. 
During her school years, she was lauded for her creativity and unique ideas but had to let go of her passion.
As she grew older, her kids all grown and away from home, she decided on giving her passion for pattern making another try. 
Hence, started AV's Clothing Store. During it's prime, it once sold close to a 1,000 clothes in a month. 
Now it continues to grow popularity among the new generation crowd.

Ms Anna Kendrick, who is the current store owner had worked with Ms Nemble until 2016, after which she bought the store. 
Ms Nemble, continues to be a regular at the store even through her retirement and will forever be known as Miletown's most loved pattern maker.
