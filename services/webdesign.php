<h1>Welcome To ABC Designers</h1>
<p>This template is coded in W3C valid HTML 5 and CSS 3, it has been tested in internet explorer 10, Google Chrome, and Firefox. Detailed instructions on how to configure a facebook likebox like the one shown in the sidebar are also enclosed within HTML comment tags in the templates index.html file.</p>
<blockquote>He who seeds a thought, harvests a destiny.<cite>ABC Proverb</cite></blockquote>
<p>ABC is released on a creative commons licence, this means you are free to use the template for both business and personal purposes but the web designers link in the footer must remain. The link has been styled to be as unobtrusive as possible and every attempt has been made to give this template the the look and feel of a professionally designed website rather than that of a free template.</p>
<p>ABC also features social media buttons which allow you to quickly and easily display your LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter profiles to people visiting your site.</p>
<p>The footer area also contains three additional navigations, allowing you to provide links to terms of use, privacy policy and cookie policy pages without sacrificing the overall aesthetics of your website. If this template is well received I may consider porting it to wordpress in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>Because the site is coded in valid HTML 5 and CSS 3, page load times are very quick which is beneficial for search engine optimisation, the file size of the page you are reading is just 5.9kb. The Main navigation mouseover images are also pre-loaded to ensure a smooth and enjoyable user experience.</p>
<p>If you enjoy using this template and would like to receive updates regarding my future work, please visit my blog by clicking the links in the sidebar and either subscribe via rss to receive email updates, or follow me on Twitter, Facebook, or Google Plus.</p>
